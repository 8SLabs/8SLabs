Students often find it difficult to do their labs because every lab needs the right platform to be installed and configured properly first. 
So I am creating paltform specific machine images as per the Labs of Bachelor of Engineering courses in India. 
I will regularly update this file.
The images are stored in multiple .ova files. 
These files first needs to be downloaded and extracted as necessary using 7-zip.
Once downloaded, the student or teacher needs to use 7-zip to combine all the files in folder to create a single .ova file
Once single .ova file is created, open Oracle Virtual box, click on menu File -> Import Appliance option and select your single .ova machine image file here
Once the import process is completed, you should see the machine in your virtual box, ready to use
The username and password for every machine is tcoestudent and tcoe2024#.
